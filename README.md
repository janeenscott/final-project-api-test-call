# Final Project Proposal and User Stories
### Proposal
Better World Buddies uses demographic data to pair pen pals so that children can form authentic friendships with people of different life experiences without traveling.

### User Stories
“As a ________ I want ______ so that ________ “

1. As a student, I want to make a new friend and learn new things about the world by getting to know what his/her life is like so that I can have a better understanding of the world and be more compassionate.

2. As a student paired with a pen pal, I want to be able to talk to them regularly so that we can deepen our friendship.

3. As a student making a new friend, I want some prompts to help facilitate conversation so that we really learn about each other.

4. As a student with a new friend from somewhere I’ve never seen, I want some cool information about their home so that I can have a little context.

5. As a student, I want to receive an email when I have been assigned a buddy so that I know when I can start chatting.

6. As a student, I want to be able to upload a profile picture so that my buddy knows what I look like.

7. As a student, I want to have a fun, attractive site to log into so that it’s not lame to look at while I’m talking to my buddy.

8. As a student, I want a blog feature where I can write a short public post about my experience with my buddy.

### Stretch Goals

1. As a teacher, I want to create a classroom network where I can see all of the students in my class and their buddies so that I can make sure they have all been matched and are participating.

2. As a teacher, I want to be able to turn messaging on and off during different times so that conversation can be monitored, and so that they are not messaging when they should be doing other things.

3. As a teacher I want to be able to read messages sent between students so that I can monitor safety and so that I can help facilitate conversation if students are struggling and need assistance connecting with their buddies.

4. As a student, I want to be able to send images to my buddy so that we can share pictures of our family, school, pets, and other aspects of our lives.

5. As a parent, I want to receive occasional updates about the buddy program so that I can engage with my child and find out about their new friendship.

6. As a teacher, I want to be able to see statistics on class engagement, like who is sending messages and how many they are sending.

7. As a teacher or a parent, I want to see deeper demographic information about the place my student’s buddy is from so that I can understand the setting the other child is coming from more deeply.
